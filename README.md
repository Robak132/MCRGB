## Features:
### A Color Picker for Minecraft Blocks!
MCRGB is a client-side Minecraft Mod designed to assist building. It allows you to search for blocks based on the dominant colors in their textures. 
Press the color picker key (I by default) to open the color picker GUI.

### HSV, HSL, RGB and Hex Support!
Input your colors using your favourite color space, and the mod will suggest blocks that closely match that color.
If you are in Creative Mode and have Operator Level Permissions, you can click blocks to give them to yourself. 

You can also see the breakdown of a block's color info by hovering over it. This tells you the percentage each color takes up in each texture, and which blockstates it corresponds to.
Optional: You can also view this info in regular inventories by changing the config.

## How it works:

On first launch, MCRGB will generate a file, located in `.minecraft/mcrgb_forge_colors/file.json`
MCRGB attempts to scan every block texture in the game and calculates the dominant colors by grouping together similar pixels based on their euclidean distance in sRGB space, and calculating the mean average of each group. The results are saved in this file. If you ever need to regenerate the file (if you've changed resource packs or added new mods which add more blocks), click the "Refresh" button in the color picker UI.

When you input a color to the color picker, the list of blocks is sorted by the euclidean distance to each of the dominant colors in each texture. Each texture is weighted according to how much of that color takes up in the texture.
